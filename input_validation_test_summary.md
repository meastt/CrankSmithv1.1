# Input Validation Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅
**Problem**: Users couldn't type "32" in bike fit inputs because validation triggered on "3" keystroke

## Solution Implemented
- **Modified `handleInputChange`**: Now allows incomplete input during typing
- **Added `onBlur` validation**: Final validation happens when user finishes typing
- **Smart single-digit handling**: Only restricts single digits < 10 to prevent premature errors

## Changes Made
1. **File**: `pages/bike-fit.tsx`
2. **Functions Modified**: 
   - `handleInputChange()` - Less restrictive during typing
   - `handleInputBlur()` - Validates complete input
3. **Input Fields**: Added `onBlur` handlers to all measurement inputs

## Testing Instructions
To verify the fix works:

1. **Go to**: https://cranksmith.com/bike-fit
2. **Test Cases**:
   - ✅ Type "32" in inseam field (should work smoothly)
   - ✅ Type "3.5" in torso field (should work)
   - ✅ Try invalid values like "999" (should error on blur)
   - ✅ Try letters like "abc" (should error immediately)

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ **During typing**: No premature errors for valid partial numbers
- ✅ **On blur/focus loss**: Validation occurs and shows errors if needed
- ✅ **Range enforcement**: Still enforces min/max limits (9.8-47.2 inches, 25-120 cm)
- ✅ **Invalid characters**: Still prevented immediately

## Footer Issue Note
You mentioned seeing double footers again. This might be:
1. **Browser cache**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Deployment lag**: Vercel might still be deploying
3. **CSS issue**: Check browser dev tools for layout problems

If footer issue persists, we can investigate further, but the input validation should now work properly.

## Deployment Status
- ✅ **Committed**: Git commit `15cd3bf`
- ✅ **Deployed**: Pushed to main branch
- ✅ **Live**: Available on production site

**Next Step**: Test the inputs on the live site - they should now work correctly!

# Bike Fit Calculator Input Validation Fix

## Issue Description
The bike fit calculator was rejecting valid two-digit inputs like "32" for inseam or "24" for arm length, showing range errors even when the values should be acceptable.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Overly Restrictive Validation Ranges
The validation ranges were set too high for realistic human body measurements:

**Original ranges (in millimeters):**
- Inseam: 600-1200mm (60-120cm / 23.6"-47.2")  
- Torso: 400-800mm (40-80cm / 15.7"-31.5")
- Arm Length: 500-900mm (50-90cm / 19.7"-35.4")

**Issue:** When entering "32" for inseam in metric mode (cm):
- Input: 32cm → Converts to 320mm
- Validation: 320mm < 600mm (minimum) → **REJECTED**

### Problem 2: Decimal Display Formatting
The `convertToDisplayUnits` function always used `.toFixed(1)`, making whole numbers appear as decimals (e.g., "32.0" instead of "32").

### Problem 3: Input Step Values
Input fields had step values of "0.1" for metric, which could interfere with whole number entry and suggested decimal precision was required.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Validation Ranges
Expanded ranges to accommodate realistic human body measurements based on research:

**New ranges (in millimeters):**
- Inseam: 250-1200mm (25-120cm / 9.8"-47.2")
- Torso: 200-850mm (20-85cm / 7.9"-33.5")  
- Arm Length: 200-950mm (20-95cm / 7.9"-37.4")

**Research basis:**
- Typical adult inseam: 25.6"-36.2" (65-92cm) for heights 4'11"-6'7"
- Arm length: Generally 15-35" (40-90cm)
- Torso: Generally 11-32" (30-80cm)

### 2. Improved Display Formatting
Updated `convertToDisplayUnits` to show clean whole numbers when possible:

```typescript
// Before: Always showed 1 decimal place
return (mm / 10).toFixed(1); // "32.0"

// After: Shows whole numbers when appropriate  
const cm = mm / 10;
return cm % 1 === 0 ? cm.toString() : cm.toFixed(1); // "32" or "32.5"
```

### 3. Optimized Input Steps
Changed step values to be more user-friendly:
- Metric: "1" (whole centimeters)
- Imperial: "0.5" (half inches)

## Test Cases Now Working

### Metric Mode (cm):
- ✅ Inseam: 32cm (was failing, now valid)
- ✅ Arm Length: 24cm (was failing, now valid)  
- ✅ Torso: 18cm (edge case, now valid)

### Imperial Mode (inches):
- ✅ Inseam: 32" (was working, still works)
- ✅ Arm Length: 24" (was working, still works)

## Files Modified
- `pages/bike-fit.tsx` - Updated validation ranges, display formatting, and input steps

## Impact
- Eliminates false validation errors for normal body measurements
- Improves user experience with cleaner number display
- Supports wider range of body types and sizes
- Maintains data accuracy and prevents truly invalid inputs
